# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Toe project with oop

  Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os.
A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. 

  This program implements the Tic-Tac-Toe game behaviour.
